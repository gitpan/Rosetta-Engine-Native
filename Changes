    * Rosetta-Engine-Native Release 0.1.0/0.001000 (SVN r1203).

    * This release is concurrently available in both Perl 5 and Perl 6
    versions.  The Perl 5 version is in the same distribution as this
    Changes file.  The Perl 6 version is bundled with Pugs-6.2.11 (released
    on 2006-02-01), in its ext/Rosetta-Engine-Native/ subdirectory.

    * Initial code file versions are: Native.pm 0.1.0 and en.pm 0.1.0.

    * Initial external dependencies are: 'version', 'only', 'Readonly'
    1.03, Class::Std 0.0.4, Class::Std::Utils 0.0.2, Locale::KeyedText
    1.72.0, 'Rosetta' 0.720.0, Test::More, Rosetta::Validator 0.720.0.

    * This is the first release of the Rosetta-Engine-Native distribution.
    This is the first release of any distribution to contain
    Rosetta::Engine::Native.  This is the first release of any distribution
    for which some of the existing work that became the
    Rosetta-Engine-Native distribution was in the form of executable code,
    and not just design documentation.

    * This is the initial file manifest:

    * This is when I started writing self-contained code components that
    were explicitly designed to enable external code that used them to work
    seamlessly on multiple database products, and hence 2002 is the start
    of my declared copyright date range for the Rosetta framework.
